I am Virgilia, the Asumcordas. Do you want to know the secrets of this Kingdom? You send the pidgeon to the right place.

There is a secret that you need to know, now that you work for the Royal Family, a big family. Big enough to keep the legitimate [url=witch.foundPrincess]Princess of Earauthain in a Tower at Lesukar[/url]. 

Oh damn, not again, I cannot keep a secret!
