I will now head to Thiperis with the love of my live. I just felt in love with the Royal Guard of my prison. 

You know I really appreciated your father and because of that I want to invite you and your family to [url=princess.escape]my wedding[/url] next year.

Thank you again Maester.

Princess Nylfena."
